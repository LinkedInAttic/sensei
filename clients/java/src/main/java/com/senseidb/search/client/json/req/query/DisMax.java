/**
 * <p>
 * A query that generates the union of documents produced by its subqueries, and
 * that scores each document with the maximum score for that document as
 * produced by any subquery, plus a tie breaking increment for any additional
 * matching subqueries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is useful when searching for a word in multiple fields with different
 * boost factors (so that the fields cannot be combined equivalently into a
 * single search field). We want the primary score to be the one associated with
 * the highest boost, not the sum of the field scores (as Boolean Query would
 * give). If the query is “albino elephant” this ensures that “albino” matching
 * one field and “elephant” matching another gets a higher score than “albino”
 * matching both fields. To get this result, use both Boolean Query and
 * DisjunctionMax Query: for each term a DisjunctionMaxQuery searches for it in
 * each field, while the set of these DisjunctionMaxQuery’s is combined into a
 * BooleanQuery.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The tie breaker capability allows results that include the same term in
 * multiple fields to be judged better than results that include this term in
 * only the best of those multiple fields, without confusing this with the
 * better case of two different terms in the multiple fields.The default
 * <code>tie_breaker</code> is <code>0.0</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This query maps to Sensei <code>DisjunctionMaxQuery</code>.
 * </p>
